# Meta Reinforcement Learning
This is a repo used to store experiements and a collection of work that I've done during the work of my master thesis. There will be a final repository where all the code for the research is stored. This repo is more a study repo.

## TODO
- Implement WANDB for garage to monitor progress.
- Train ML10 baselines using garage starting with MAML\_TRPO.
- Start working on an off-policy solution. Using context maybe? [Efficient Off-Policy Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Probabilistic Context Variables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08254.pdf)
